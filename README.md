CPSC481 T03-Group03 - Trip Management System

** We recommend clearing your browser cache between runs, in order to allow for new data to be stored in localStorage **

- Enter the hosted webpage at: https://trainormax.github.io/CPSC481-ProjectPrototype/ (or locally view the html files in the GitHub repo)

- The only days populated with events are June 1st, June 2nd, and June 3rd

- Since we do not have any backend storage, this project only supports 1 trip to be planned as we use localStorage to store user and choice data
	
	- This means that after a trip has been booked, a new trip cannot be planned until the browser cache has been cleared
