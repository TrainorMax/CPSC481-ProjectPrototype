## Trip Management System

### ðŸ”— Accessing the Prototype
You can access the hosted webpage at: https://trainormax.github.io/CPSC481-ProjectPrototype/ (or locally view the html files in the GitHub repo)

### Usage Recommendations
** We recommend clearing your browser cache between runs, in order to allow for new data to be stored in localStorage **

- Only June 1st, 2nd, and 3rd are populated with events, so we recommend selecting one of these dates when planning your trip

- Since we do not have any backend storage, this project only supports planning one trip at a time, using localStorage to store user and choice data 

- This means that after a trip has been booked, a new trip cannot be planned until the browser cache has been cleared
